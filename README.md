# MGS2 Audio Tool

An audio-modding tool for **Metal Gear Solid** games on PC — currently
**Metal Gear Solid 2: Master Collection** (2023) and **Substance** (2003),
with an architecture designed to support more games in the future
(MGS3, ZoE, etc.).

Open the game's audio, listen, export to WAV, and (for dialogue) replace it
with your own. A **game selector** at the top switches which tabs are shown
and recolours the whole window. Each game gets its own colour theme: green for
Master Collection, amber for Substance.

## Project status

- **MGS2 Master Collection — stable.** Every MC tab works on real game data:
  dialogue browsing/export/replacement (SDT), sound-bank scan and replacement
  (SDX), the cue sequencer, and music replacement (Musique · BGM) —
  **confirmed working in the actual game**, including the Unity
  FSB5/Addressables-CRC handling that makes replaced bundles load.
- **More MC features are in development** (e.g. the launcher's 13 UI sounds
  share one bundle and can't be replaced individually yet).
- **MGS2 Substance (2003) — work in progress.** Browsing and WAV export work
  (VOX, BGM, Dém, SDX open-only), but several formats are still being
  reverse-engineered: the `vox.dat` codec is unconfirmed, `demo.dat` decodes
  with artefacts, the Substance `.sdx` layout diverges from MC's, and no
  Substance replacement path exists yet. See `docs/AUDIT.md` for the open
  questions.

### Master Collection tabs

- **SDT · Dialogues** — character voice lines (replaceable, for custom dubs).
- **Musique · BGM** — the 6 scenario music tracks (ARMS DEPOT, BATTLE,
  INFILTRATION…) plus the launcher's main-menu and credits music, stored as
  Unity AssetBundles in the game install. Listen, export to WAV, and
  **replace a track with your own WAV** — the tool rebuilds a valid `.bundle`
  and shows each file's exact path inside the game folder so you know what to
  swap. Requires the optional `UnityPy` dependency (below).
- **SDX · Sound banks** — the stage sample banks (footsteps, doors, weapons…).
  Full scan mode: index every bank in the game, group identical sounds, edit
  one and rewrite all copies at once.
- **Séquenceur · Cues SDX** — the raven-accurate synth that renders the SE cue
  sequences hidden in the `.sdx` banks. **These are raw sound effects, not the
  game's full orchestrated music** — real orchestration needs a separate `mdx`
  file (see below) that has never been found; if one turns up, it would likely
  get its own dedicated tab rather than folding into this one.

### Substance (2003) tabs

- **VOX · Voices** — `vox.dat`, the game's full voice archive (53 K PS-ADPCM
  blocks at 44 100 Hz). Listen, export, or dub individual blocks.
- **SDX · Sound effects** — `pk000000`–`pk000005.sdx`, six banks of stage
  samples (22 050 Hz). Open one at a time.
- **Musique · BGM** — `bgm.dat`, `movie.dat`: pre-rendered MS-ADPCM music
  streams (98 + 90 entries), decoded straight to WAV.
- **Dém Cutscenes** — `demo.dat`: the cutscene and demo audio (135 MS-ADPCM
  entries), same decode-and-export workflow.

> **How the music works.** The `.sdx` cue sequences are driven like a MIDI file
> by the PS2 sound driver — faithfully reproduced here from the **`KieronJ/raven`**
> reference (tempo, pitch via `freq_tbl`, per-instrument tuning/pan/ADSR, sweep,
> glissandi, portamento, vibrato, reverb). Those cues are mostly **sound effects**;
> the actual orchestrated **BGM** is streamed as MS-ADPCM in `bgm.dat` on PC and
> extracted directly. See `docs/AUDIT_SDX.md`, `docs/ORCHESTRATION.md`, `docs/AUDIT.md`.
>
> Reading works everywhere. **Replacing** works for Master Collection music
> (the Musique · BGM tab, via Unity bundles) and for dialogue — not yet for
> Substance's streamed `bgm.dat` music.

> **The `.sdt` files come from the Better Audio Mod.** That mod restores the PS3
> HD Collection audio in PS-ADPCM, which is what this tool decodes. Many stock
> Steam `.sdt` files use a different codec; the tool detects them and says so
> rather than playing noise.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.10+**
- **PyQt6** — `pip install PyQt6` (only needed for the graphical interface)
- **UnityPy** — `pip install UnityPy` (optional; only needed by the Master
  Collection **Musique · BGM** tab, which reads/rebuilds Unity AssetBundles)
- **[MGS2MC Better Audio Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsolid2mc)** for
  the `.sdt` dialogue files
- A legal copy of the game. Use only files from your own installation.

The engine underneath (`mgs2_audio.codec`, `mgs2_audio.formats`) is pure Python
with **no dependencies at all** — the command line works without PyQt6.

## Install and run

Download the project, then:

```bash
pip install PyQt6
python run.py
```

## What it does

### The SDT tab — dialogue (Master Collection)

1. **Voice folder** — point it at a folder of `.sdt` files. The list appears
   instantly, even for a thousand of them.
2. **Database folder** — where your tags and notes are stored, kept separate
   from the game files.
3. Single-click a file to tag it, double-click to load and hear it.
4. Mark it **done**, give it a free-text **tag**, a **speaker**, and **notes**.
5. Pick your recording, generate the modified `.sdt`, and drop it back in the game.

Search by name, tag, speaker or notes; filter by *done / to do* or by tag.
Tagging is entirely manual — the tool never guesses whether a line is finished.

> **Every tab can be tagged**, not just SDT — SDX, VOX, BGM, Dém and Séquenceur
> each keep a done/tag/notes panel and their own database file. The **database
> folder is picked once per game** (a control in the app header, next to the
> mode selector) — Master Collection and Substance never share tags.

### The VOX tab — voice archive (Substance)

Open `vox.dat` (the Substance voice archive). Its 53 K PS-ADPCM blocks are
listed; pick one to listen and export, or pick a WAV to dub it. The file
dialogue opens on `.dat` by default.

### The SDX tab — sound effects

**Master Collection** — open a single bank, or **scan the whole game**: point
it at your MGS2 folder and it finds `us/stage` on its own, indexes every bank,
and groups identical sounds.

**Substance** — open one of the six `pk*.sdx` banks (scan mode is not available:
Substance banks use a different internal layout). The open dialog filters on
`.sdx` by default.

### The BGM / Dém tabs — streamed music

**Master Collection** — open a `.sdx` bank and its musical pieces appear in a
list. Click one and it is synthesised and played, right there. Export a piece,
or every piece at once. Two options change the synthesis: **stereo** (uses each
track's pan) and **tune** (uses each instrument's base rate, 44 100 Hz).

**Substance** — the **BGM** tab opens `bgm.dat` or `movie.dat` (pre-rendered
MS-ADPCM streams). The **Dém** tab opens `demo.dat` (cutscene audio). Both
list entries with sample rate, channel count and duration; select one to listen
and export, or export all at once.

### The music sequencer, from the command line

The `.sdx` banks carry more than samples: they carry the score. List a bank's
cues and render them to WAV:

```bash
python -m mgs2_audio.cli seq cues   pk000002.sdx --min-notes 20
python -m mgs2_audio.cli seq render pk000002.sdx melody.wav
python -m mgs2_audio.cli seq render pk000002.sdx out/ --all --min-notes 8
```

Without `--cue`, the busiest cue is rendered — usually the music. Rendering is a
small software SPU: one voice per track, samples that loop while a note holds,
volume, pan, pitch bend, portamento and transpose.

It will sound thinner than the game. The PlayStation applied reverb in hardware,
and that was never stored in any file.

### The command line

No Qt, no GUI, scriptable:

```bash
python -m mgs2_audio.cli sdt info    vc000101.sdt
python -m mgs2_audio.cli sdt export  vc000101.sdt out.wav
python -m mgs2_audio.cli sdt replace vc000101.sdt dub.wav out.sdt

python -m mgs2_audio.cli sdx list        pk000000.sdx
python -m mgs2_audio.cli sdx scan        "C:/Games/.../MGS2"
python -m mgs2_audio.cli sdx export-key  "C:/Games/.../MGS2" <key> sound.wav
python -m mgs2_audio.cli sdx replace-all "C:/Games/.../MGS2" <key> mine.wav
```

`scan` accepts the game folder, a language folder, or the stage folder itself.

## Tips

- Record at the file's own rate if you can — **44100 Hz** for `.sdt`,
  **22050 Hz** for `.sdx`. Otherwise the tool resamples.
- **Length is fixed.** Longer audio is trimmed, shorter is padded with silence.
  The output keeps the original's exact byte size, which the game requires.
- On a stereo `.sdt`, your mono recording is placed on both channels.
- **Back up before your first `replace-all`.** `.bak` files are written
  automatically, but a copy of `stage/` costs nothing.

## Architecture

```
run.py                 launch the GUI
mgs2_audio/
    codec/             PS-ADPCM, MS-ADPCM and WAV. Knows nothing about MGS2.
    formats/           sdt.py, sdx.py, sequence.py, bgm.py — the game's file formats.
                       detect.py does structural auto-detection.
    library/           the tagging databases.
    render.py          a small software SPU: plays a sequencer cue.
    core/              GamePlugin ABC, PageSpec, REGISTRY — the plugin interface.
        base.py        GamePlugin, PageSpec, AudioFormat, AudioContainer
        registry.py    Plugin discovery and global registry
    games/             Each game is a subpackage that registers itself.
        mgs2_mc/       MGS2 Master Collection (SDT, SDX, Sequencer)
        mgs2_substance/ MGS2 Substance 2003 (VOX, SDX, BGM, DEMOS)
    ui/                PyQt6 interface (app.py = shell, one page per tab).
    cli.py             the command line.
docs/FORMATS.md        the reverse-engineering notes.
tests/                 pytest suite, no game files needed.
```

Each layer only knows about the ones below it. Games are self-contained
plugins discovered at import time — the UI shell never imports game-specific
code directly. Adding a new game means creating a new subpackage in
`mgs2_audio/games/<id>/` with a `Plugin` class that extends `GamePlugin`.

**Read [`docs/FORMATS.md`](docs/FORMATS.md) first** if you want to understand the
files, contribute, or build something else on this. The code can be rewritten;
that knowledge took much longer to find.

Run the tests with:

```bash
pip install pytest
python -m pytest
```

They build synthetic `.sdt` and `.sdx` files from scratch — no game data needed,
and this default run stays deliberately light (a few seconds, no brute-force
PS-ADPCM encoding of anything but real test content). A handful of tests
additionally validate against real game files if you have them under
`tests/mgs2_substance_2003/` — those are opt-in (`python -m pytest --realdata`)
since parsing a 1+ GB file is slow and genuinely CPU-heavy; they're skipped by
default so a plain test run never pins a core for that long.

### Running just what you're touching

The suite is split one file per subsystem, so `pytest tests/test_X.py` runs
only what's relevant to `X` — no need for the full suite (or `--realdata`)
while iterating on one area. Cheaper on the CPU, and faster to read.

| Working on…                              | Run                          |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| PS-ADPCM / MS-ADPCM codecs                 | `pytest tests/test_codec.py` |
| `.sdt` format (dialogue) / `vox.dat`       | `pytest tests/test_sdt.py`   |
| `.sdx` format (sound banks)                | `pytest tests/test_sdx.py`   |
| `bgm.dat` / `movie.dat` / `demo.dat`       | `pytest tests/test_bgm.py`   |
| MC music bundles (`formats/mcbgm.py`)      | `pytest tests/test_mcbgm.py` |
| The sequencer / `render.py` (SPU, reverb)  | `pytest tests/test_sequence.py` |
| Tagging databases (`library/db.py`)        | `pytest tests/test_library.py` |
| The app shell (`ui/app.py`, `db_folder`)   | `pytest tests/test_app.py`   |

A single test also works (handy while chasing one failure):
`pytest tests/test_bgm.py::test_quad_matches_separate_stereo_decode`.

Reach for the full `pytest` (or `--realdata`) run before a release, or
whenever a change might have touched more than one subsystem — not as the
default while developing.

## Known limitations

- **Encoding is slow.** The PS-ADPCM encoder is pure Python and brute-forces the
  best filter and shift for every 28 samples of real audio. Generating a long
  dub can take a while and may look frozen. Silence is fast-pathed (a `.sdt`
  replacement always pads or trims to the target's exact byte size, and the
  padding/trimmed-away portion is often mostly silence), but the real recorded
  audio itself still goes through the full search. Decoding is fast.
- **Scanning the whole game** (Master Collection only) reads ~200 banks of about
  1 MB each. Give it a minute; the progress bar is honest, and you can cancel.
- **Substance `.sdx` banks** use a different internal layout (`voice_tbl` not at
  `0x800`); they don't parse in the raven sequencer yet. Open-only mode.
- **Substance `vox.dat` playback is suspect.** It's currently decoded as PS-ADPCM,
  but the container structure suggests the actual codec may be Konami's
  DPCM_KCEJ instead — unconfirmed by ear. See `docs/AUDIT.md` before relying on it.
- **Substance `codec.dat`** (`b9 2a 90 3d` header) is an unknown format; reverse
  engineering is still needed. It is excluded from the UI for now.
- **Stereo dubs are duplicated** across both channels. True left/right stereo
  replacement is not supported.
- **`replace-all` writes to your game files** in place (with `.bak` backups).
- **Windows-focused.** It should run anywhere PyQt6 does; other platforms are
  untested.
